jump test: 
have code with several labels
main:
#code
jump to success
error:
#code
success:
#code

#if the jump fails, the error label is the next part in the code, so it will automatically run
otherwise, success wil be called which would print some output saying it worked.

jump register test:
main:
addi $t0, $zero, 5
sw $a0, $ra
addi $t1, $t1, 1
 
beq $t0, $t1, success

jumptest:
jr $a0

Error:
#print error statement
exit

success:
#print success statement

Jump and Link test:
		.data
string1		.asciiz	"Should Appear Once.\n"		# declaration for string variable, 
						# .asciiz directive makes string null terminated

		.text
main:
li $v0, 4			# load appropriate system call code into register $v0;
						# code for printing string is 4
la $a1, string1		# load address of string to be printed into $a0
syscall				# call operating system to perform print operation
addi $t2, $zero, 1
jal intermediate

beq $t1, $t2, success



error:
#error message

intermediate:
addi $t1, $t1, 1 
jr $ra #return to where we jumped from

success:
#print success
